## What is React?
- JavaScript library (not a framework) used to build interactive user interfaces.
- Framework provides a complete solution to building the front end solutions. Therefore React only provides a view to create user-interfaces
- Used to create a dynamic single page application
- single page application renders small pieces of user interface, and make the complete application
- in react, you can build reusable UI component
- meaing when you create a navbar as a UI component, you can use the same navbar in different pages
- these components are arranged in a hierarchy called a 'virtual dom'.
- virtual dom is the hierarchy of components which imitate the real dom of the browsers. When you update any changes to the virtaul dom, react compares the real and virtaul dom, and the changes mde in the virtaul dom is updated in the real dom, and the same appears in the browser
- react supporst a new syntax called jsx (stands for JavaScript with XML) - can use javascript and xml in the same program
- html tags are written in the form of xml
